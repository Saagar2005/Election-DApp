# Project Report: Gymkhana Elections DApp
## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Gymkhana Elections DApp, a decentralized application (dApp) that operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers connected through the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike traditional applications controlled by a single authority, dApps like ours embrace transparency and autonomy.  This enables our campus junta to engage in the election process without fear of censorship or manipulation.
